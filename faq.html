You may also notice soft spots when walking on the roof, circular cracks in shingles, exposed fiberglass mat, or dark spots where granules have been knocked off. Inside your home, look for water stains on ceilings, peeling paint near rooflines, or damp spots in the attic. Additionally, check other exterior surfaces like window screens, siding, air conditioning units, and deck railings for dents or damage, as these can indicate your roof was also affected. However, hail damage isn't always visible from the ground, which is why we recommend a free professional inspection after any significant storm."
